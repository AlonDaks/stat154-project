  The shepherds slept, and the sheep slept too,
    Till the angels' song and the bright star ray
  Guided the wise men to the spot.

  But only the wise men knelt and praised,
    And only the shepherds came to see,
  And the rest of the world cared not at all
  For the little Christ in the oxen's stall;
    And we are angry and amazed
  That such a dull, hard thing should be!

  How do we keep his birthday now?
    We ring the bells and we raise the strain,
  We hang up garland, everywhere
  And bid the tapers, twinkle fair,
    And feast and frolic--and then we go
  Back to the Mine old lives again.

  Are we so better, then, than they
    Who failed the new-born Christ to see?
  To them a helpless babe,--to us
  He shines a Saviour glorious,
    Our Lord, our Friend, our All--yet we
  Are half asleep this Christmas day.




BENEDICAM DOMINO.

  Thank God for life: life is not sweet always.
  Hands may he heavy-laden, hearts care full,
  Unwelcome nights follow unwelcome days,
  And dreams divine end in awakenings dull.
  Still it is life, anil life is cause for praise.
  This ache, this restlessness, this quickening sting,
  Prove me no torpid and inanimate thing,
  Prove me of Him who is of life the Spring.
  I am alive!--and that is beautiful.

  Thank God for Love: though Love may hurt and wound
  Though set with sharpest thorns its rose may be,
  Roses are not of winter, all attuned
  Must be the earth, full of soft stir, and free
  And warm ere dawns the rose upon its tree.
  Fresh currents through my frozen pulses run;
  My heart has tasted summer, tasted sun,
  And I can thank Thee, Lord, although not one
  Of all the many roses blooms for me.
