    Ah, soon on golden purple wing
    The liberated soul shall spring,
         Which now creeps as a worm!

    Teach me, O Lord, to yonder skies
    To lift in hope these weary eyes
         With earthly sorrows worn.
    Good Friday was a bitter day,
    But bright the sun's eternal ray
         Which broke on Easter morn.


THE END.
