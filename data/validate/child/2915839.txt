grandfather got better; his heart was never broken by the knowledge of
that terrible disgrace which the child so feared that she would bring
him. Mrs. Church became one of the Irish alms-women, and grumbled a good
deal at the change in her position. Mrs. Hopkins's debt was cleared off;
and all the characters in this story did well, and were proud to admit
that they owed most of their future prosperity to the Wild Irish Girl,
Kathleen O'Hara.

THE END.
