way through. Nothing can withstand fire. It is very remarkable that the
symbol used most for God in the Bible is fire. A man never amounts to
anything until he catches fire.

The proportions are worth noticing here. Thirty-two thousand were
_volunteers_. A third of that number are _courageous_ volunteers. About a
thirty-third of these, less than a hundredth of the original, are
_hot-hearted, courageous_ volunteers.

This is Gideon's Band; three hundred young men fresh from the farm, who
were _willing_, and _courageous_, and _hot-hearted_, all heart qualities.
They stood every test. They had faced a foe that humanly they had no
chance to overcome, and because of God's call they were not only willing,
and stout-hearted, but intense in their desire to get at the fighting.

Then under Gideon's leadership they were well fed, and organized; they
proved individually faithful in the thick of the fight, and they pushed
persistently on even when bodily tired out. And the nation knew a great
victory over its enemies, and a time of prosperity for years after.

God is still sifting men for service. He will use gladly every man who is
willing to be used. When a man stands the first test well, there comes a
second. That, stood well, means others. These are our promotion tests. He
lets those who stand all testings into the thickest of the fight and up to
the highest heights of victory.

Master, help us to endure every test as seeing Him who is invisible.
