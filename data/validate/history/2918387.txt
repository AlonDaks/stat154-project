WOMAN'S FRIENDSHIP.

A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.

By GRACE AGUILAR.

_With Illustrations. One volume, 12mo. Cloth. Price, $1.00._

  "To show us how divine a thing
   A woman may be made."--Wordsworth.

"This story illustrates, with feeling and power, that beneficial
influence which women exercise, in their own quiet way, over characters
and events in our every-day life."--_Britannia._

"The book is one of more than ordinary interest in various ways, and
presents an admirable conception of the depths and sincerity of female
friendship, as exhibited in England by English women."--_Weekly
Chronicle._

"We began to read the volume late in the evening; and, although it
consists of about 400 pages, our eyes could not close in sleep until we
had read the whole. This excellent book should find a place on every
drawing-room table--nay, in every library in the kingdom."--_Bucks
Chronicle._

"We congratulate Miss Aguilar on the spirit, motive, and composition of
this story. Her aims are eminently moral, and her cause comes
recommended by the most beautiful associations. These, connected with
the skill here evinced in their development, insure the success of her
labors."--_Illustrated News._

"As a writer of remarkable grace and delicacy, she devoted herself to
the inculcation of the virtues, more especially those which are the
peculiar charm of women."--_Critic._

"It is a book for all classes of readers; and we have no hesitation in
saying, that it only requires to be generally known to become
exceedingly popular. In our estimation it has far more attractions
than Miss Burney's celebrated, but overestimated, novel of
'Cecilia.'"--_Herts County Press._

"This very interesting and agreeable tale has remained longer without
notice on our part than we could have desired; but we would now endeavor
to make amends for the delay, by assuring our readers that it is a most
ably-written publication, full of the nicest points of information and
utility that could have been by any possibility constructed; and, as a
proof of its value, it may suffice to say, that it has been taken from
our table again and again by several individuals, from the
recommendation of those who had already perused it, and be prevented our
giving an earlier attention to its manifold claims for the favorable
criticism. It is peculiarly adapted for the young, and wherever it goes
will be received with gratification, and command very extensive
approbation."--_Bell's Weekly Messenger._

"This is a handsome volume: just such a book as we would expect to find
among the volumes composing a lady's library. Its interior corresponds
with its exterior; it is a most fascinating tale, full of noble and just
sentiments."--_Palladium._

THE VALE OF CEDARS

or,

THE MARTYR.

A STORY OF SPAIN IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.

By GRACE AGUILAR.

_With Illustrations. 1 vol., 12mo. Cloth, $1.00._

"The authoress of this most fascinating volume has selected for her field
one of the most remarkable eras in modern history--the reigns of Ferdinand
and Isabella. The tale turns on the extraordinary extent to which concealed
Judaism had gained footing at that period in Spain. It is marked by much
power of description, and by a woman's delicacy of touch, and it will add
to its writer's well-earned reputation."--_Eclectic Review._

"The scene of this interesting tale is laid during the reign of
Ferdinand and Isabella. The Vale of Cedars is the retreat of a Jewish
family, compelled by persecution to perform their religions rites with
the utmost secrecy. On the singular position of this fated race in the
most Catholic land of Europe, the interest of the tale mainly
depends; whilst a few glimpses of the horrors of the terrible
Inquisition are afforded the reader, and heighten the interest
of the narrative."--_Sharpe's Magazine._

"Any thing which proceeds from the pen of the authoress of this volume
is sure to command attention and appreciation. There is so much of
delicacy and refinement about her style, and each a faithful delineation
of nature in all she attempts, that she has taken her place amongst the
highest class of modern writers of fiction. We consider this to be one
of Miss Aguilar's best efforts."--_Bell's Weekly Messenger._

"We heartily commend the work to our readers as one exhibiting, not
merely talent, but genius, and a degree of earnestness, fidelity to
Nature, and artistic grace, rarely found."--_Herts County Press._

"The 'Vale of Cedars' is indeed one of the most touching and interesting
stories that have ever issued from the press. There is a life-like
reality about it which is not often observed in works of this nature;
while we read it we felt as if we were witnesses of the various scenes
it depicts."--_Bucks Chronicle._

"It is a tale of deep and pure devotion, very touchingly
narrated."--_Atlas._

"The authoress has already received our commendation; her present work
is calculated to sustain, her reputation."--_Illustrated News._

"It is indeed a historical romance of a high class. Seeing how steady
and yet rapid was her improvement--how rich the promise of her
genius--it is impossible to close this notice of her last and best work,
without lamenting that the authoress was so untimely snatched from a
world she appeared destined, as certainly she was singularly qualified,
to adorn and to improve."--_Critic._
