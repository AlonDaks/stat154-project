                =CAVEATS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE MARKS, ETC.=

  Messrs. Munn & Co., in connection with the publication of the
  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, continue to examine Improvements, and to act as
  Solicitors of Patents for Inventors.

  In this line of business they have had OVER THIRTY YEARS' EXPERIENCE,
  and now have _unequaled facilities_ for the preparation of Patent
  Drawings, Specifications, and the Prosecution of Applications for
  Patents in the United States, Canada, and Foreign Countries. Messrs.
  Munn & Co. also attend to the preparation of Caveats, Trade Mark
  Regulations, Copyrights for Books, Labels, Reissues, Assignments, and
  Reports on Infringements of Patents. All business intrusted to them
  is done with special care and promptness, on very moderate terms.

  We send free of charge, on application, a pamphlet containing further
  information about Patents and how to procure them; directions
  concerning Trade Marks, Copyrights, Designs, Patents, Appeals,
  Reissues, Infringements, Assignments, Rejected Cases, Hints on the
  Sale of Patents, etc.

  =_Foreign Patents._=--We also send, _free of charge_, a Synopsis of
  Foreign Patent Laws, showing the cost and method of securing patents
  in all the principal countries of the world. American inventors
  should bear in mind that, as a general rule, any invention that is
  valuable to the patentee in this country is worth equally as much in
  England and some other foreign countries. Five patents--embracing
  Canadian, English, German, French, and Belgian--will secure to an
  inventor the exclusive monopoly to his discovery among about ONE
  HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIONS of the most intelligent people in the
  world. The facilities of business and steam communication are such
  that patents can be obtained abroad by our citizens almost as easily
  as at home. The expense to apply for an English patent is $75;
  German, $100; French, $100; Belgian, $100; Canadian, $50.

  =_Copies of Patents._=--Persons desiring any patent issued from
  1836 to November 26, 1867, can be supplied with official copies at
  reasonable cost, the price depending upon the extent of drawings and
  length of specifications.

  Any patent issued since November 27, 1867, at which time the Patent
  Office commenced printing the drawings and specifications, may be had
  by remitting to this office $1.

  A copy of the claims of any patent issued since 1836 will be
  furnished for $1.

  When ordering copies, please to remit for the same as above, and
  state name of patentee, title of invention, and date of patent.

  A pamphlet, containing full directions for obtaining United States
  patents sent free. A handsomely bound Reference Book, gilt edges,
  contains 140 pages and many engravings and tables important to every
  patentee and mechanic, and is a useful hand book of reference for
  everybody. Price 25 cents, mailed free.

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES

Obvious punctuation errors have been corrected.

Spelling inconsistencies have been retained.

On page 83, the clause "It has an independent extinguisher for the
smaller wick tube" had "ndependent" in the original.

On page 91, the ad reading "The Turbine Wheel made by Risdon & Co., Mt.
Holly, N. J., gave the best results at Centennial tests." had "tets" in
the original.

On page 92, the patent named "Gas, scintillator for lighting" was
numbered "204,28" in the original. The final "5" has been added because
sorting the list reveals that the patent numbers form a consecutive
series from 204,122 to 204,413, with the only one missing being 204,285.

On page 92, the patent named "Shoetip" was guessed at; the "t" is
unclear in the original.

On page 94, the phrase "Alcohol Oxidized in the System." had no
terminating punctuation in the original.

On page 94, the illustration containing the words "Diamonds and
Carbor", the "Carbor" may be an abbreviation for "Carborundum"; the
image is unclear in the original.

On page 94, in the advertisement for "WATSONS [sic] NON [sic] CHANGEABLE
GAP LATHE", the abbreviation "MANR." had the "R" as a superscript in the
original.
