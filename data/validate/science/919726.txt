FANGS OF THE WOLF WORLD


At one time Race Cargill had been the best Terran Intelligence agent on
the complex and mysterious planet of Wolf. He had repeatedly imperiled
his life amongst the half-human and non-human creatures of the sullen
world. And he had repeatedly accomplished the fantastic missions until
his name was emblazoned with glory.

But that had all seemingly ended. For six long years he'd sat behind a
boring desk inside the fenced-in Terran Headquarters, cut off there ever
since he and a rival had scarred and ripped each other in blood-feud.

But when THE DOOR THROUGH SPACE swung suddenly open, the feud was on
again--and with it a plot designed to check and destroy the Terran
Empire.
