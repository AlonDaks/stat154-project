FOOTNOTES:

[62] For the materials of this Article the Translator is indebted to
Professor Robertson.

[63] It is said, _Belidor Archit. Hydrog._ to contain 31 oz. 64 grs.
of water, which makes it 58.075 English inches; but, as there is
considerable uncertainty in the determinations of the weight of the
French cubical measure of water, owing to the uncertainty of the
standards made use of, it is better to abide by Mr Everard's measure,
which was with the Exchequer standards, and by the proportions of the
English and French foot, as established by the French Academy and Royal
Society.
