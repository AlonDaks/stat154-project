which will travel faster than light ... they give us what may have been
the first space-warp drive. The concept was simple; to make it plausible
wasn't--unless you were John Campbell.

"With this out-of-space drive they hightail it among the stars. They
locate the fugitive planets of the Black Star ... find a frozen
cemetery-world of a lost race ... then head out for another galaxy ... and
wind up in a knock-down-drag-out interplanetary war in the other
galaxy."
