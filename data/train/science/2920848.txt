A LABORATORY COURSE IN PHYSICS

_FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS_

By ROBERT A. MILLIKAN and HENRY G. GALE 12mo, flexible cloth, 134 pages,
illustrated, 40 cents

This one-year course in physics has grown out of the experience of the
authors in developing the work in physics at the School of Education of
The University of Chicago, and in dealing with the physics instruction
in affiliated high schools and academies.

The book is a simple, objective presentation of the subject as opposed
to a formal and mathematical one. It is intended for the third-year
high-school pupils and is therefore adapted in style and method of
treatment to the needs of students between the ages of fifteen and
eighteen. It especially emphasizes the historical and practical aspects
of the subject and connects the study very intimately with facts of
daily observation and experience.

The authors have made a careful distinction between the class of
experiments which are essentially laboratory problems and those which
belong more properly to the classroom and the lecture table. The former
are grouped into a Laboratory Manual which is designed for use in
connection with the text. The two books are not, however, organically
connected, each being complete in itself.

All the experiments included in the work have been carefully chosen with
reference to their usefulness as effective classroom demonstrations.
