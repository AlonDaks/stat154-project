
Part I.--THE HUMAN BODY.

TEACHERS' EDITION.

A TRANSCRIPT OF LESSONS GIVEN IN THE PRIMARY DEPARTMENT OF GRAMMAR SCHOOL
NO. 49, NEW YORK CITY.

This work was prepared especially to aid Teachers in giving oral
instructions in Physiology to Primary and Intermediate Classes. It is,
perhaps, the only Physiology published that is suitable for these grades.
Considerable attention is paid to the subject of Alcohol and Narcotics.

    "First is given _a model lesson_; second, _a formula_, embodying the
    principal facts given during the development and teaching; third,
    _questions for the formula_; fourth, _directions for teaching_; and
    fifth, _questions on the lesson_. These last are important. A full plan
    of lessons is given for each week for five months, in each of six
    grades, showing exactly how much work ought to be attempted. No book
    could be made more helpful to teachers. To the thousands who are
    asking, 'Tell us how to teach,' here are full, minute, and correct
    instructions. Even the answers expected are given, blackboard outlines
    are arranged, and nothing is wanting to make the book as useful to
    teachers as it is possible for any book to be. It ought to have a large
    sale. No book published during the last ten years will do more to drive
    away routine from the school-room and introduce thought than this, _if
    only the teachers will use it_. Its introduction displaces nothing but
    the old-fashioned monotonous recitations. Let them go; we welcome this
    book as an important aid in hastening along the good time of better
    teaching. It is excellently printed, with good paper and
    binding."--_The New York School Journal._

DEVELOPMENT LESSONS.

BY PROF. E.V. DEGRAFF & MISS M.K. SMITH.

IN FIVE PARTS.

I. FIFTY LESSONS ON THE SENSES, SIZE, FORM, PLACE, PLANTS, AND INSECTS.

    These lessons are presented objectively with a view to showing how
    elementary work in natural science may be done.

II. QUINCY SCHOOL WORK.

III. LECTURES ON THE SCIENCE AND ART OF TEACHING.

    Specific instruction is given on how to teach Reading, Spelling,
    Phonics, Language, Geography, Arithmetic, etc.

IV. SCHOOL GOVERNMENT.

V. "THE NEW DEPARTURE IN THE SCHOOLS OF QUINCY." By CHAS. FRANCIS ADAMS.

    DR. A.D. MAYO says, in the _New England Journal of Education_:
    "Although we have given place in our book-notice column to an
    appreciative mention of the volume, 'Development Lessons,' a new
    reading seems to call for a new commendation of this admirable guide to
    teachers. Mr. DeGraff needs no special 'boom' as a first-class
    institute man, and his extracts of lectures in Part III. sparkle with
    valuable suggestions. In no published work is Col. Parker really seen
    to such advantage as in the 'reports of conversations' with him in Part
    II., which can be studied with profit by every teacher. But perhaps the
    most complete portion of this admirable book is the 178 pages of
    lessons on the Senses, Size, Form, Place, Plants, and Insects, by MISS
    M.K. SMITH, now Teacher of Methods in the State Normal School at Peru,
    Neb."
