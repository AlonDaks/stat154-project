Terminology

  oxy-muriatic acid = chlorine
    (proposed as an element in 1815: see Conversation XIX)
  "columbium or tantalium" = niobium and tantalum
    (the two elements always occur together, and were not recognized
    as separate until much later in the 19th century)
  phosphat of lime = calcium diphosphate _or_ calcium
    (the element calcium was isolated in 1808, but is named only once
    in this 1817 edition)
  glucium = beryllium (Humphry Davy's name for the element)

  muriatic acid = hydrochloric acid
    (still called "muriatic acid" for some commercial uses)
  muriat of lime = calcium chloride
  oxymuriate of potash = potassium chlorate
  muriat of soda = sodium chloride (table salt)
  carbonic acid = carbon dioxide

Note also:

  simple body, fundamental principle = element
  fecula = starch (usually spelled "faecula")
  spirit of wine = alcohol
  philosopher = scientist
  arts = industry, manufacture, crafts etc. (seldom "fine arts")

Some essential concepts relating to living things--photosynthesis,
microorganisms, the cell, proteins--are either unknown or not mentioned.
The atom theory had been proposed, but not by Humphry Davy; it is not
mentioned in this book.

The word "explode" is used at least once in its orginal, figurative
sense ("a word that should be exploded in chemistry") but far more
often in its later, concrete one. The word "explosion" is always used
concretely ("an explosion, or a _detonation_ as chemists commonly call
it").

Calculated Values:

"the point of zero, or the absolute privation of heat, must consequently
be 1260 degrees below 32 degrees"

  [-1228 deg. F. The calculation is based on wrong premises; the correct
  figure is about -460 deg. F or -273 deg. C.]

"Mercury congeals only at seventy-two degrees below the freezing point."

  [-40 deg. F, which is also -40 deg. C. This figure is correct, though
  approximate.]

"The proportion stated by Sir H. Davy, in his Chemical Researches, is as
1 to 2.389."

"[ammonia] consisted of about one part of hydrogen to four parts of
nitrogen.... and from the latest and most accurate experiments, the
proportions appear to be, one volume of nitrogen gas to three of
hydrogen gas"

  [These and similar calculations involving weight and volume make more
  sense when one knows the elements' atomic weights. For nitric acid,
  HNO_3, the figures are 1:14:48, giving a proportion closer to 1:3.5.
  For ammonia, NH_3 (not 4), the figures are 14:3.]

"The _oxalic acid_, distilled from sorrel, is the highest term of
vegetable acidification; for, if more oxygen be added to it, it loses
its vegetable nature, and is resolved into carbonic acid and water;"

  [Oxalic acid = H_2C_2O_4; carbonic acid (carbon dioxide) = CO_2.
  H_2C_2O_4 + O becomes H_2O + CO_2 + CO_2.]

ERRATA

Inconsistencies are generally unchanged; see end of Errata list.

Two items are noted in the printed Errata, immediately after the
Contents for Vol. I:

  Vol. I. page 56. last line but one, for "caloric," read "calorific."
              179. Note, for "Plate XII." r. "Plate XIII."

    The principal use of the mirrors in this experiment is, to prove
    that the calorific emanation ...

Inconsistencies and variant spellings:

Standard spellings in this book include:
  bason, judgment, embrio, volcanos (plural), potatoe (singular)

Inconsistencies include:
  capitalization of "Fig." or "fig."
  hyphenization of words such as "oxy-muriatic"
  "glauber salt" and "Glauber's salt" both occur

Variant forms include:
  opake, opaque
  aeriform, aeriform (with and without dieresis)
  gasses, gases
  phosphoret, phosphuret (but always carburet)
  Libya, Lybia
  dy(e)ing  [from "dye"]
  nap(h)tha
  pla(i)ster
  slak(e)ing
  earthen-ware, earthen ware
  "sulphurous", "naphtha" are used in the Contents and the Index;
    "sulphureous", "naptha" in the body text
  forms in "-xion" (such as "connexion") appear only in the Contents
    and the Index

Volume I has more archaic forms than Volume II:
  "shew", "inclose" are sometimes used instead of "show", "enclose"
  "carbone" with final "e" appears in one Plate caption. (In the
    same plate's header, the "e" appears to have been removed by
    the engraver.)
  "develope(ment)" is more common in Volume I, "develop(ment)" in
    Volume II
  "-ize" and "-yze" forms (for later "-ise" and "-yse") are common in
    Volume I, rare in Volume II except in the Index


The "Dr. Marcet" mentioned in a few footnotes and figure captions is the
author's husband. Humphry Davy ("Sir H. Davy") was knighted in 1812,
between the 3rd and 4th editions of the book.
