  WHAT A FRIEND WE HAVE IN JESUS,                 425
  WHAT SHALL A DYING SINNER DO,                    43
  WHAT SHALL THE HARVEST BE,                      434
  WHAT VARIOUS HINDRANCES WE MEET,                131
  WHEN ALL THY MERCIES, O MY GOD,                 113
  WHEN FOR ETERNAL WORLDS I STEER,                286
  WHEN HE COMETH, WHEN HE COMETH,                 314
  WHEN I CAN READ MY TITLE CLEAR,             43, 514
  WHEN GATHERING CLOUDS AROUND I VIEW,            212
  WHEN ISRAEL OF THE LORD BELOVED,                240
  WHEN I SURVEY THE WONDROUS CROSS,           42, 109
  WHEN LANGUOR AND DISEASE INVADE,                137
  WHEN MARSHALLED ON THE NIGHTLY PLAIN,           364
  WHEN MY FINAL FAREWELL TO THE WORLD,       441, 442
  WHEN OUR HEADS ARE BOWED WITH WOE,              278
  WHEN PEACE LIKE A RIVER,                        440
  WHEN SHALL WE ALL MEET AGAIN,              265, 266
  WHEN TWO OR THREE WITH SWEET ACCORD,             24
  WHERE IS MY WANDERING BOY TO-NIGHT?             446
  WHERE NOW ARE THE HEBREW CHILDREN?              270
  WHILE JESUS WHISPERS TO YOU,                    418
  WHILE SHEPHERDS WATCHED THEIR FLOCKS,           465
  WHILE THEE I SEEK, PROTECTING POWER,       125, 207
  WHILE WITH CEASELESS COURSE THE SUN,            493
  WHY SHOULD WE START AND FEAR TO DIE,            512
  WIDE, YE HEAVENLY GATES UNFOLD,                 168
  WITH JOY WE HAIL THE SACRED DAY,                168
  WITH SONGS AND HONORS SOUNDING LOUD,            479
  WITH TEARFUL EYES I LOOK AROUND,                214

  YE CHOIRS OF NEW JERUSALEM,                  59, 60
  YE CHRISTIAN HERALDS, GO PROCLAIM,         171, 172
  YE CHRISTIAN HEROES, WAKE TO GLORY,             174
  YE GOLDEN LAMPS OF HEAVEN, FAREWELL,            519
  YE SERVANTS OF GOD, YOUR MASTER PROCLAIM,       204
  YES, MY NATIVE LAND, I LOVE THEE,               180
  YES, THE REDEEMER ROSE,                         476
  YOUR HARPS; YE TREMBLING SAINTS,                517
