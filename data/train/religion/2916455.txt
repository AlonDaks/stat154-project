Now to the Lord a noble song,                    11

Oh, bless the Lord, my soul,                     20
Oh, bliss of the purified! bliss of the,        348
Oh, come, loud anthems let us sing,              13
Oh! could I find from day to day,               258
Oh, could I speak the matchless worth,          303
O day of rest and gladness,                      44
Oh, do not let the word depart,                 203
Oh, eyes that are weary and hearts,             368
Oh, for a closer walk with God,                 330
Oh, for a faith that will not shrink,           364
Oh, for a heart to praise my God,               331
Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing,             288
O God, our help in ages past,                    78
Oh, happy day, that fixed my choice,            466
O Holy Savior, Friend unseen,                   279
Oh, how happy are they,                         248
O, I often sit and ponder,                      530
O Jesus full of grace,                          271
O, Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord,                  292
O Jesus! sweet the tears I shed,                123
O Lord, how full of sweet content,              343
O Love I who gav'st thy life for me,            140
Oh, now I see the cleansing wave,               283
Oh, render thanks to God above,                  10
O, sacred head, now wounded,                    120
Oh, scatter seeds of loving deeds,              414
Oh, still in accents sweet,                     463
Oh, that I could forever dwell,                 314
Oh, that my load of sin were gone,              232
Oh, the peace that fills my soul,               255
O, think of the home over there,                517
O thou, in whose presence my soul,              323
Oh, Thou, the contrite sinner's Friend,         354
Oh thou, whose own vast temple stands,           41
Oh, turn ye, oh turn ye, for why,               215
Oh, weary pilgrim, lift your head,              382
Oh, what if we are Christ's,                    359
O when shall I see Jesus,                       296
On! where are kings and empires,                432
Oh, where shall rest be found,                  228
Oh, wondrous, deep, unbounded love,             244
Oh, wondrous type, oh, vision fair,             113
O worship the King, all-glorious above,          28
Of him who did salvation bring,                 320
One sweetly solemn thought,                     500
On Jordan's stormy bank I stand,                528
Only a word for Jesus,                          420
On the mountain's top appearing,                441
Onward, onward, men of heaven,                  445
Oppressed with noonday's scorching,             124
Our children, Lord, in faith and prayer,        483
Our country's voice is pleading,                456
Our Father who art in heaven,                   396
Our Lord is now rejected,                       160
Our sins on Christ were laid,                   126

Peace be still! In this night of sorrow,        502
Pour out thy Spirit from on high,               464
Praise God from whom all blessings flow,          6
Praise the Lord; ye heavens adore him,           24
Praise to God, immortal praise,                 546
Praise to thee, thou great Creator,              27
Prayer is appointed to convey,                  385
Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,            391

Rejoice and be glad, the Redeemer has,          316
Rescue the perishing,                           411
Rest, weary pilgrim, thy journey is o'er,       503
Revive thy work, O Lord,                        436
Ride on! ride on in majesty,                    112
Rise, glorious Conqueror, rise,                 150
Rocked in the cradle of the deep,               547
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,                     129

Safely thro' another week,                       48
Safe in the arms of Jesus,                      370
Salvation! oh, the joyful sound,                188
Savior, again to thy dear name we raise,         57
Savior, breathe an evening blessing,             54
Savior, more than life to me,                   309
Savior! teach me, day by day,                   342
Savior, visit thy plantation,                   442
Saw ye my Savior,                               137
Say, sinner, hath a voice within,               212
See how the morning sun,                         53
See, the Conqueror mounts in triumph,           153
See the flag of Jesus,                          459
Servant of God, well done,                      485
Shall we gather at the river,                   529
Show pity, Lord, O Lord, forgive,               233
Silently the shades of evening,                  59
Simply trusting every day,                      376
Sing them over again to me,                      62
Sing to the Lord Jehovah's name,                 19
Sinners Jesus will receive,                     193
Sinners, this solemn truth regard,              183
Sinners, turn; why will ye die,                 204
So fades the lovely, blooming flower,           492
Softly fades the twilight ray,                   51
Softly now the light of day,                     58
Soldiers of Christ are we,                      427
Soldiers of Christ! arise,                      424
Soldiers of the cross! arise,                   461
So let our lips and lives express,              407
Sometimes a light surprises,                    346
Soon may the last glad song arise,              439
Soon the evening shadows falling,               226
So tender, so precious,                         322
Sowing in the morning,                          417
Sow in the morn thy seed,                       404
Spirit Divine! attend our prayers,              168
Spirit of power, and truth and love,            173
Stand up, and bless the Lord,                    23
Stand up, stand up for Jesus,                   428
Stay, thou insulted Spirit, stay,               234
Sun of my soul, thou Savior dear,                55
Sweet hour of prayer,                           387
Sweet is the work, my God! my King,              14
Sweet the moments rich in blessing,             132

Take me, oh, my Father, take me,                270
Take my heart, dear Jesus,                      276
Take my life and let it be,                     277
Talk with us, Lord, thyself reveal,             393
Thank and praise Jehovah's name,                 25
That awful day will surely come,                508
That dreadful night, before his death,          480
The cross, the cross, the blood-stained cross,  125
The door of salvation is open wide,             231
The evening shades are falling,                 531
The head, that once was crowned with thorns,    156
The heathen perish; day by day,                 446
The Lord descended from above,                   82
The Lord is King! child of the dust,             86
The Lord is now rejected,                       160
The Lord is risen indeed,                       145
The Lord my Shepherd is,                        360
The Lord, our God, is full of might,             73
The Lord's our Rock, in him we hide,            377
The morning kindles all the sky,                147
The morning light is breaking,                  457
The morning purples all the sky,                141
The pity of the Lord,                           339
The race that long in darkness pine,             95
There are lonely hearts to cherish,             412
There is a fountain filled with blood,          186
There is a God--all nature speaks,               85
There is a land of pure delight,                514
There is a line by us unseen,                   210
There is a name I love to hear,                 294
There is an hour of peaceful rest,              521
There is a spot to me more dear,                249
There is no flock, however watched,             501
There's a glorious kingdom waiting,             158
There's a land that is fairer than day,         518
There's a stranger at the door,                 220
There's a wideness in God's mercy,              217
There shall be showers of blessing,             347
The sands of time are wasting,                  512
The Savior bids thee watch and pray,            390
The solemn service now is done,                 465
This is not my place of resting,                520
Thou! whose almighty word,                      165
Thy law is perfect, Lord of light,               71
Thy way, O God, is in the sea,                   77
Thy presence, gracious God, afford,              38
Thy will be done! In devious way,               497
Till he come! oh, let the word,                 481
'Tis grace, 'tis grace, 'tis wonderful grace,   200
'Tis midnight; and on Olive's brow,             117
'Tis the promise of God,                        252
'Tis thine alone, almighty name,                536
To-day the Savior calls,                        222
To thee, my God and Savior,                     297
Triumphant Zion! lift thy head,                 438
'Twas on that dark, that dreadful night,        478

Unfurl the Temperance Banner,                   538
Unveil thy bosom, faithful tomb,                491

Vain are the hopes the sons of men,             185

Wake, wake the song! our glad,                  545
Walk in the light! so shall thou know,          351
Wayfarers in the wilderness,                    499
We are living, we are dwelling,                 408
We bless thee for thy peace, O God,             333
We give thee but thine own,                     405
We have heard the joyful sound,                 191
We long to move and breathe in thee,            482
We may not climb the heavenly steeps,           105
We praise thee, O God, for the Son,             315
We shall meet beyond the river,                 524
Welcome, delightful morn,                        49
Welcome, O Savior! to my heart,                 259
Welcome, sacred day of rest,                     50
Welcome! sweet day of rest,                      43
What a Friend we have in Jesus,                 395
What grace, O Lord, and beauty, shone,          104
What means this glorious radiance,              103
When I can read my title clear,                 515
When I view my Savior bleeding,                 133
When I survey the wondrous cross,               119
When Jesus comes to reward his,                 422
When peace like a river,                        251
When the worn spirit wants repose,               47
When thou, my righteous Judge, shalt,           506
When wounded sore, the stricken soul,           187
While in sweet communion feeding,               479
While shepherds watched their flocks,            96
Who'll be the next to follow Jesus,             219
Why do we mourn departing friends,              493
Why do you wait, dear brother,                  207
Why should our tears in sorrow flow,            495
Why should the children of a King,              169
With joy we mediate the grace,                  157
With stately towers and bulwarks,               431
With thine own pity Savior, see,                462
Witness, ye men and angels! now,                470
Work, for the night is coming,                  416
Would you lose your load of sin,                242

Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,        29
Yes, God is good; in earth and sky,              83
Yes, we trust the day is breaking,              453
Ye wretched, hungry, starving poor,             209
Yield not to temptation,                        430

Zion, dreary and in anguish,                    444
Zion stands with hills surrounded,              440
