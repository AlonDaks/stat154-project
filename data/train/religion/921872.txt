IN THE "EXPOSITOR'S BIBLE."

      "The work of a brilliant and effective teacher. He writes with
      real power and insight."--_Saturday Review._

      "Dr. Maclaren has evidently mastered his subject with the aid of
      the best authorities, and has put the results of his studies
      before his readers in a most attractive form, and if we add that
      this commentary really helps to the better understanding of the
      Psalms, that, far from degrading, it vivifies and illuminates
      these sublime stories, and that it is written in a charming style,
      very seldom falling below the dignity of the subject, we believe
      we only give it the praise which is its due."--_Scotsman._

      "It is scholarly, honest, thoughtful, and suggestive."--_Daily
      Chronicle._

      "Striking thoughts, strongly expressed, are to be found on every
      page."--_Manchester Guardian._

      "There is certainly room for the work which Dr. Maclaren does
      here--largely because it is he who does it. The book is most
      heartily to be commended. Preachers will find it to be a mine of
      wealth, and to Christians of all kinds it may serve as a manual of
      devotion."--_Christian World._

      "Dr. Maclaren's charming pages furnish a most fruitful field of
      study, alike for those whose chief aim is personal edification,
      and for those who are in quest of suggestions in the line of
      ministerial service. Altogether a most valuable book."--_United
      Presbyterian Magazine._

      "Most heartily do we welcome this new volume of Dr. Maclaren's
      'Exposition of the Psalms.' It fully sustains the traditions of
      insight, scholarly instinct, and spiritual force which gather
      around that beloved name. Notwithstanding the rich treasures of
      devout literature which the Psalter has called forth, there is a
      special niche for this book, and it makes a distinct advance in
      tone and method upon all other commentaries on the Psalms. We
      greatly err if this does not prove the most popular and useful
      commentary in the English language, both among preachers and the
      commonality of Christ's Church."--_Evangelical Magazine._

THE GOSPEL OF ST. MATTHEW.

TWO VOLS.

      "They are all written in clear, forcible language, and bring
      abundant illustration from science, the facts of life and history
      and Scripture. All through they manifest a true philosophical
      spirit, and a deep knowledge of human nature. None can read them
      without profit."--_Leeds Mercury._


THE GOSPEL OF ST. MARK.

      "As clear, luminous, and pellucid as is everything that comes from
      the pen of the great Manchester preacher. Even in treating the
      simplest incident he surprises his readers, and that without once
      forcing the note, or seeking sensationalism."--_Christian World._


THE GOSPEL OF ST. LUKE.

      "Dr. Maclaren is a prince of expositors, and his expositions are
      as wholesome as they are able, and as interesting as they are
      instructive and edifying. Every paragraph is luminous with vivid
      expression."--_The London Quarterly Review._


THE GOSPEL OF ST. JOHN.

      "There is much freshness and suggestiveness in these papers. Dr.
      Maclaren has studied the art of compression with great success,
      and no teacher of a class could desire anything better for his
      purpose than these lessons. They may be heartily recommended to
      all teachers as about the best things of the kind to be
      had."--_Glasgow Herald._


THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES.

      "The more this volume is read and studied the more do we admire
      the humility that ranks such a book as for Bible Classes only. It
      is for them beyond all question, and better fare has nowhere been
      provided for them. Whether they be Bible Classes or preachers who
      study this volume they will be enriched and strengthened by
      it."--_Presbyterian._
