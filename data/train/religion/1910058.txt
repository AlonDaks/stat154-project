London. Price 1s. 6d). A good selection from Catholic and non-Catholic
translators. The translations of Dr. Neale, Anglican--held to be
superior in fidelity and in poetic form to that of any English
translator--are given in this booklet. Neale's _Collected Hymns_ (Hodder
& Stoughton, 6s.) are useful for translators and composers of vernacular
hymns. But his work is, I think, over-rated.

(4) Other translations of Breviary hymns are found in the collections of
hymns used in Anglican churches: _Hymns, Ancient and Modern; The English
Hymnal; The Hymner from the Sarum Breviary_ (Plain-song and Mediaeval
Society, London); _Songs of Sion_, by Woodward, etc.

For advanced study of liturgy, Dom Cabrol's _Dictionaire D'Archeologie
Chrietienne Et Liturgie_ (Paris: Letouzey et Ane) is indispensable. Its
study delights and consoles those who possess it.
