"To judge from the style in which their present work is edited, the
number of cases cited bearing upon the various sections, the ample notes
appended where any explanation is necessary, and the full and complete
indexes to the cases cited, we have little hesitation in saying that,
while undoubtedly it is at present the best work on the subject, it need
fear no competition in the future."--_Englishman._
