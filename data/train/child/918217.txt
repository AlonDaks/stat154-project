The wild rose--
    Grows in hedges.
    Has five leaves.
    Has berries called 'hips.'




WOOD.                         [_Page 111._


1. Wood seems to be almost as useful as iron. Hundreds of years ago,
houses were built of wood. All the houses in London were. There is much
wood in our houses now.

2. There are many kinds of wood--each comes from a different tree. Oak
is a very hard wood. Pine is softer. Willow is very soft; its thin
branches will bend easily. It is used for making baskets.

3. When the trunk of a tree is sawn into planks we can see the grain or
marks in it. Some are very prettily marked. Oak and walnut are. Wood can
be highly polished.

Wood grows--
    In most countries.
    In forests.
    Plentifully.

Wood is--
    Very useful.
    Mostly hard.
    Grained.

Wood is used for--
    Building purposes.
    Furniture.
    Fires.




COAL.                         [_Page 113._


1. Coal is dug out of the earth. Coal and iron are found together. But
coal is not a metal as iron is. It will not melt. We call it a mineral.

2. It is found in many parts of the world. There is a very large
quantity in our own country.

3. It is a black, shiny, opaque, and brittle mineral. Men have to go
deep down into the earth, into mines, to get it. They are in great
danger.

4. Coals were once forests, which sank lower and lower into the earth
hundreds and thousands of years ago. They became mixed with other
things, and in time were changed to coal. We can see the grain in some
of the coal, as we see it in wood.

Coal is--
    A Mineral.
    Black.

Coal is used for--
    Fuel.
    Smelting metals.
    Making gas.
    Making tar.




FIRE.                         [_Page 119._


1. Fire is useful but dangerous. A spark from it might set a house on
fire. We ought to be very careful about it. Children should never play
with fire.

2. It is so useful that we should not be able to have many things we
have, if we had no fire.

3. When England was covered with forests, hundreds of years ago, people
used to have fires of wood, instead of coal. Wood-fires are not so smoky
as those made of coal, but they are not so hot.

_Write and learn:_

Fire is--
    Useful.
    Dangerous.
    A good servant.
    A bad master.

Fire--
    Burns.
    Smokes.
    Makes flame.
    Gives heat.

Fire--
    Warms our houses.
    Cooks our food.
    Makes water into steam.
    Makes soot.
