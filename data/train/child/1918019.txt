        MEG OF MYSTERY MOUNTAIN

        This story tells of the summer vacation some young people spent
        in the mountains and how they cleared up the mystery of the lost
        cabin at Crazy Creek Mine.

        RILLA OF THE LIGHTHOUSE

        "Rilla" had lived all her life with only her grandfather and
        "Uncle Barney" as companions, but finally, at High Cliff
        Seminary, her great test came and the lovable girl from Windy
        Island Lighthouse met it brilliantly.

        NAN OF THE GYPSIES

        In this tale of a wandering gypsy band, Nan, who has spent her
        childhood with the gypsies, is adopted by a woman of wealth, and
        by her love and loyalty to her, she proves her fine character
        and true worth.

        SISTERS

        The personal characteristics and incidents in the lives of two
        girls--one thoughtless and proud, the other devoted and
        self-sacrificing--are vividly described in this story, told as
        it is with sympathy and understanding for both.
