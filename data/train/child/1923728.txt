the whole business. Now that I've got Lola home I don't much care
about the rest of it. What do you say we let well enough alone and
drop it?"

"I should say that with every day of your life you were growing wiser,
my dear," answered his wife softly.

_The first volume in "The Invention Series"_

PAUL AND THE PRINTING PRESS

_By_ SARA WARE BASSETT

With illustrations by A. O. Scott

_12mo. Cloth. 218 pages._

Paul Cameron, president of the class of 1920 in the Burmingham High
School, conceives the idea of establishing a school paper, to the
honor and glory of his class. So _The March Hare_ comes into
existence, and Paul and his schoolfellows bend all their energies to
making it a success. They have their difficulties and Paul in
particular bears the brunt of their troubles, but _The March Hare_
lives up to its reputation for life and liveliness and becomes not
only a class success, but a town institution. This is the first volume
in "The Invention Series."

"It is the sort of story that boys of fourteen years and upward
will enjoy and ought to enjoy, a combination that is rarely
achieved."--_Boston Post._

"A welcome volume which will appeal to boys who want a good story that
will give some information as well."--_New York Evening Post._

"'Paul and the Printing Press' not only has a keen story interest, but
has the advantage of carrying much valuable information for all young
folks for whom the mysterious and all-powerful printing press has an
attraction."--_Boston Herald._
