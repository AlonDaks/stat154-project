
Both jumped down, and the horses started.

"Look, look, Grandfather," cried Erick quickly, and pulled the
grandfather in front of him, so that he could see better. "Look, there
is Marianne's little house. Do you see the small window? There Mother
always sat and sewed, and you see, close beside it stood the piano,
where Mother sat the very last time and sang."

The grandfather looked at the little window and he frowned as though he
were in pain.

"What did your mother sing last, my boy?" he then asked.

     "I lay in heaviest fetters,
     Thou com'st and set'st me free;
     I stood in shame and sorrow,
     Thou callest me to Thee;
     And lift'st me up to honor
     And giv'st me heavenly joys
     Which cannot be diminished
     By earthly scorn and noise."

When Erick had ended, the grandfather sat for a while quiet and lost in
thought; then he said: "Your mother must have found a treasure when in
misery, which is worth more than all the good luck and possessions which
she had lost. The dear God sent that to her, and we will thank Him for
it, my boy. That, too, can make me happy again, else the sight of that
little window would crush my heart forever. But that your mother could
sing like that, and that you, my boy, come into my home with me, that
wipes away my suffering and makes me again a happy father."

The grandfather took Erick's hand lovingly in his, and so they drove
toward the distant home.
