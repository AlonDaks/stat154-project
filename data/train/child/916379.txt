GOODWIFE (_sharply)._ No, no! I love the king!--the king himself!

KING (_growling)._ Out upon King Alfred! Out upon him, I say!

GOODWIFE (_angrily)._ You are a traitor, sir!

KING. What has he done for England? He has lost every battle to the
Danes! He is running from them now!

GOODWIFE. 'Tis no fault of his! If the king's men were as brave as he,
there would not be a Dane on English land to-day!

KING (_still growling_). Well, I'm glad there's one that thinks so well
of him!

GOODWIFE. You are a traitor and should be punished!

(_Taking up stick._)

I myself will do it!

[_Lifting stick. Enter the_ PRINCE _and_ ENGLISH SOLDIERS.]

PRINCE (_kneeling_). Your Majesty is safe!

GOOD WIFE (_aside_). What!--Your Majesty, they say!

SOLDIERS (_kneeling, joyfully_). King Alfred! King Alfred!

GOODWIFE (_aside)._ What!--King Alfred!--

KING. Rise, my Prince! Rise, my soldiers! Ah, I'm glad they did not find
you!

[_He grasps their hands._]

GOODWIFE (_aside; showing fear_). It is--it is--the king!

KING. We'll fight again, my men! At daybreak we'll surprise them.

SOLDIERS. Aye! Aye!

KING. Goodwife, your king now thanks you.

GOODWIFE (_kneeling_). Oh, your Majesty, forgive me! forgive me!

KING (_gently_). Arise, goodwife.

GOODWIFE (_rising_). Alas the day I made you fry the cakes! Alas the day
I would have beaten you!

KING. Nay, goodwife, 'twas that saved my life. I bless the day you made
me fry the cakes! I bless the day you would have beaten me! (_Lifting
his hand over her head._)

And you I bless, goodwife, for your loyalty to England and her king!
Soldiers, salute this brave goodwife!

[_Soldiers form in a double line from door of hut, and hold their bows
aloft to make an arch. The Goodwife passes up this lane, under the bows,
and stands in door of hut. The King and the Prince salute her._]
