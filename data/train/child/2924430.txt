After a while the song was done, and other songs were sung; but it was
not long before Uncle Remus discovered that the little boy was fast
asleep. The old man took the child in his arms and carried him to the
big house, singing softly in his ear all the way; and somehow or other
the song seemed to melt and mingle in the youngster's dreams. He thought
he was floating in the air, while somewhere near all the negroes were
singing, Uncle Remus's voice above all the rest; and then, after he had
found a resting-place upon a soft warm bank of clouds, he thought he
heard the songs renewed. They grew fainter and fainter in his dreams
until at last (it seemed) Uncle Remus leaned over him and sang

    GOOD-NIGHT
