     "'Nelly's Story' is told in such a good and pleasant way,
     and withal is so useful and world-like, that we trust it may
     bring to its authoress the fame that she is well able to
     support."--_Tait's Magazine._

     "We recognize and proclaim in the authoress of this
     thrilling tale a quality beyond mere ability--genius of a
     very high order. We claim for Anna Lisle a place amongst the
     most distinguished writers of her age. The story is a
     brilliant effort of refined and sanctified imagination
     throughout, quite as fascinating as anything in the way of
     story, whether told by Scott, Stowe, Dickens, or Currer
     Bell."--_Sentinel._

QUICKSANDS

A TALE.

BY ANNA LISLE.

     "It is a thoroughly woman's book. We can fairly say that we
     have seldom met with a graver or more striking warning
     against the consequences of over eagerness about worldly
     position and advantages, more forcibly and, at the same
     time, gracefully conveyed."--_Literary Gazette._

     "Contains a great deal of quiet and powerful writing. Marty,
     the maid of Mrs. Grey, might pass for a creation of Dickens.
     The moral of 'Quicksands' is at once comprehensive and
     striking."--_Weekly Mail._
