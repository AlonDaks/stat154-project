(hence its pertinence here) and was noted for its many festivals and bad
morals,--the latter being superinduced by the presence in the city of a
large floating population of foreigners and sailors. The atmosphere of
the town (to compare small things with great) was, in a word, that of
Corinth.]

[Footnote 76: The custom was that the magistrates should issue from the
town to meet the triumphator and then march ahead of him. Octavius by
