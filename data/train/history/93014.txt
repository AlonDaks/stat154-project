approach to a moving narrative is James K. Hosmer, "Short History of
the Mississippi Valley" (1901), which tells the story of the Middle West
from the earliest explorations to the close of the nineteenth century,
within a brief space, yet in a manner to arouse the reader's interest
and sympathy. A fuller and very readable narrative to 1796 will be found
in Charles Moore, "The Northwest under Three Flags" (1900). Still more
detailed, and enlivened by many contemporary rasps and plans, is Justin
Winsor, "The Westward Movement" (1899), covering the period from the
pacification of 1763 to the close of the eighteenth century. Frederick
J. Turner, "Rise of the New West" (1906) contains several interesting
and authoritative chapters on western development after the War of 1812;
and John B. McMaster, "History of the People of the United States" (8
vols., 1883-1913), gives in the fourth and fifth volumes a very good
account of westward migration.

An excellent detailed account of the settlement and development of a
single section of the Northwest is G. N. Fuller, "Economic and Social
Beginnings of Michigan," Michigan Historical Publications, Univ. Series,
No.1 (1916). A very readable book is R. G. Thwaites, "The Story of
Wisconsin" (rev. ed., 1899), containing a full account of the early
relations of white men and red men, and of the Black Hawk War. Mention
may be made, too, of H. E. Legler, "Leading Events of Wisconsin History"
(1898).

Among the volumes dealing with the diplomatic history of the Northwest,
mention should be made of two recent studies: C. W. Alvord, "The
Mississippi Valley in British Politics" (2 vols., 1917), and E. S.
Corwin, "French Policy and the American Alliance" (1916).

Aside from Lincoln, few men of the earlier Northwest have been made the
subjects of well-written biographies. Curiously, there are no modern
biographies, good or bad, of George Rogers Clark, General St. Clair,
or William Henry Harrison. John R. Spears, "Anthony Wayne" (1903) is
an interesting book; and Andrew C. McLaughlin, "Lewis Cass" (1891),
and Allen Johnson, "Stephen A. Douglas" (1908) are excellent. Lives
of Lincoln that have importance for their portrayal of western society
include: John T. Morse, Jr., "Abraham Lincoln" (2 vols., 1893); John G.
Nicolay and John Hay, "Abraham Lincoln, a History" (10 vols., 1890); and
Ida M. Tarbell, "Life of Abraham Lincoln" (new ed., 2vols., 1917).

The reader will do well, however, to turn early to some of the works
within the field which, by reason of their literary quality as well as
their scholarly worth, have attained the dignity of classics. Foremost
are the writings of Francis Parkman. Most of these, it is true, deal
with the history of the American interior prior to 1763. But "Frontenac
and New France under Louis XIV" (Frontenac edition, 1915), and "A
Half-Century of Conflict" (2 vols., same ed.) furnish the necessary
background; and "The Conspiracy of Pontiac" (2 vols., same ed.) is
indispensable. Parkman's work closes with the Indian war following the
Treaty of 1763. Theodore Roosevelt's "Winning of the West" (4 vols.,
1889-96) takes up the story at that point and carries it to the collapse
of the Burr intrigues during the second administration of Thomas
Jefferson. This work was a pioneer in the field. In the light of recent
scholarship it is subject to criticism at some points; but it is based
on careful study of the sources, and for vividness and interest it
has perhaps not been surpassed in American historical writing. A third
extensive work is Archer B. Hulbert, "Historic Highways of America"
(16 vols., 1902-05). In writing the history of the great land and
water routes of trade and travel between East and West the author found
occasion to describe, in interesting fashion, most phases of western
life. The volumes most closely related to the subject matter of the
present book are: "Military Roads of the Mississippi Valley" (VIII);
"Waterways of Western Expansion" (IX); "The Cumberland Road" (X); and
"Pioneer Roads and Experiences of Travellers" (XIXII). Mention should be
made also of Mr. Hulbert's "The Ohio River, a Course of Empire" (1906).

Further references will be found appended to the articles on Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin in "The Encyclopaedia Britannica"
(11th edition).

Opportunity to get the flavor of the period by reading contemporary
literature is afforded by two principal kinds of books. One is
reminiscences, letters, and histories written by the Westerners
themselves. Timothy Flint's "Recollections of the Last Ten Years" (1826)
will be found interesting; as also J. Hall, "Letters from the West"
(1828), and T. Ford, "History of Illinois" (1854).

The second type of materials is books of travel written by visitors
from the East or from Europe. Works of this nature are always subject
to limitations. Even when the author tries to be accurate and fair,
his information is likely to be hastily gathered and incomplete and
his judgments unsound. Between 1800 and 1840 the Northwest was visited,
however, by many educated and fair-minded persons who wrote readable
and trustworthy descriptions of what they saw and heard. A complete
list cannot be given here, but some of the best of these books are: John
Melish, "Travels in the United States of America in the Years 1806 &
1807 and 1809, 1810 & 1811" (2 vols., 1810; William Cobbett, A Year's
Residence in the United States of America (1818); Henry B. Fearon,
Sketches of America (1818); Morris Birkbeck, Letters from Illinois
(1818); John Bradbury, "Travels in the Interior of America in the Years
1809, 1810, and 1811" (1819); Thomas Hulme, "Journal made during a Tour
in the Western Countries of America, 1818-1819" (1828); and Michael
Chevalier, "Society, Manners, and Politics in the United States" (1839).
Copies of early editions of some of these works will be found in
most large libraries. But the reader is happily not dependent on this
resource. Almost all of the really important books of the kind are
reprinted, with introductions and explanatory matter, in Reuben G.
Thwaites, "Early Western Travels, 1714-1846" (32 vols., 1904-07), which
is one of our chief collections of historical materials.
