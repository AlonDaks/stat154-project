

A SONG FROM THE SUDS.

Queen of my tub, I merrily sing,
  While the white foam rises high,
And stur-di-ly wash and rinse and wring,
  And fasten the clothes to dry;
Then out in the free fresh air they swing,
  Under the sunny sky.

I am glad a task to me is given,
  To labor at day by day;
For it brings me health and strength and hope,
  And I cheer-ful-ly learn to say,
"Head you may think, Heart you may feel,
  But Hand you shall work alway."


Louisa grew to be a woman at last. She went to nurse soldiers in the
war. She wrote books. When she wrote the book called "Little Women,"
all the young people were de-light-ed. What she had said to the crow
came true at last. She became famous. She had money enough to make the
family com-fort-a-ble.
