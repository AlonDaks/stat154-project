understanding of early industrial conditions. The general course of
industry and commerce in the United States is briefly told by Carroll D.
Wright in "The Industrial Evolution of the United States" (1907), by E.
L. Bogart in "The Economic History of the United States" (1920), and by

(1910-11), edited by John R. Commons, is a mine of material. See also
Emerson D. Fite, "Social and Industrial Conditions in the North During
the Civil War" (1910). The best account of the inventions of the
nineteenth century is "The Progress of Invention in the Nineteenth
Century" by Edward W. Byrn (1900). George Iles in "Leading American
Inventors" (1912) tells the story of several important inventors and
their work. The same author in "Flame, Electricity and the Camera"
(1900) gives much valuable information.
